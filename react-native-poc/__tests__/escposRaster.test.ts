/**
 * Locks the raster command that actually reaches paper.
 *
 * This exists because of a real receipt handed to a real customer at
 * Hbiah: the app had been switched to `GS 8 L` fn112 / `GS ( L` fn50 on
 * the theory that the obsolete `GS v 0` was what made printing take 45
 * seconds. The printer does not implement fn112 — and an ESC/POS printer
 * that does not know a command does not ignore it, it prints the payload
 * as characters. A whole slip of `<<<<` and `aaaa`.
 *
 * Nothing caught it, because every test in the repo asserted what the
 * bitmap PACKING did and none asserted which command wrapped it.
 *
 * So: the byte-level assertions below are the guard. If someone flips the
 * default back to the modern command, this fails before a build reaches a
 * counter — not after a customer is holding the paper.
